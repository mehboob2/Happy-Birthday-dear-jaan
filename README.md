Happy Birthday Samira - Ready-to-deploy webpage
---------------------------------------------

What is inside:
- index.html    -> main page (typing effect + Yes/No intro + audio placeholder)
- style.css     -> styles for the page
- README.md     -> this file
- song.mp3      -> (NOT included) placeholder file name for background music

How to use:
1. Download and extract the ZIP.
2. Put your background music MP3 file in the same folder and rename it to 'song.mp3' (or change the audio src in index.html).
3. To preview locally, open index.html in your browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox). If audio doesn't autoplay, click 'Yes' to start (that click allows audio to play).
4. To publish online (recommended) - use GitHub Pages or Netlify:
   - Create a new public GitHub repository.
   - Upload all files from this folder (index.html, style.css and song.mp3).
   - On GitHub go to Settings → Pages → choose branch 'main' (or 'master') and folder '/ (root)' → Save.
   - Wait a minute, then your site will be available at:
     https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

Notes:
- I did NOT include the copyrighted song; add your own MP3 as 'song.mp3'.
- The typing effect shows the messages in sequence. Clicking the page advances faster.
